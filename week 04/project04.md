# 04 - Project : Mad Lib

# 0 - Setup

The following project will require you write and run your own Python code.  There are a number of ways to do this.

- Thonny on your computer.
- Online sites such as https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ or https://www.trinket.io/.  You are able to create free accounts on these websites.
- You are free to write your project in either version 2 or 3 of Python.


# 1 - Objectives

- Prompt the user for nouns and verbs.
- Use those answers to create a resulting Mab Lib story.

# 2 - Overview

This project will implement a simple Mab Lib story.  Please refer to [Mad Lib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) for more information.  Your project will ask a few questions where you will prompt for some nouns and verbs.  Then, it will display the resulting Mad Lib where it will contain those nouns and verbs that were entered.

# 3 - Instructions

## 3.1 - Sample Code

Here is a sample Mad Lib program.  Please copy it in Thonny or your online Python editor.  It's here so you can run it to see how it works.

```python
adjective1 = input("Tell me an adjective, and click enter. ")
noun1 = input("Tell me a noun (plural), and click enter. ")
noun2 = input("Tell me another noun, and click enter. ")
adjective2 = input("Tell me an another adjective, and click enter. ")

print("Roses are " + adjective1)
print(noun1 + " are blue")
print(noun2 + " is " + adjective2)
print("And so are you!")
```

Here is a sample of the program running.

```
Tell me an adjective, and click enter. happy
Tell me a noun (plural), and click enter. cars
Tell me another noun, and click enter. house
Tell me an another adjective, and click enter. large
Roses are happy
cars are blue
house is large
And so are you!
```

## 3.2 - Your Project

For your project, impliment one of the following Mad Libs.  Your code will be in the same structure as the sample code above (ie., ask questions, get answers and then create the resulting story).  You can format the resulting Mad Lib any way you like as long as it can be read.

# 4 - Submitting

After you have finished writting and testing your program:

1. Take a screen shot of your code and the results of running your code.  You should be able to do this in one screen shot.  If not, take screen shots of each.
2. Upload your screen shot image(s) to the Assignment Section in I-Learn for the course.  You will find an item for this project.
