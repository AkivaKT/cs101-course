    "Operators allow you the programmer to compare variables in your program.  Here are some of the more common operators for comparing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x == y               # x equal to y \n",

    "x < y                # x is less than y\n",
    "x >= y               # x is greater than or equal to y\n",
    "x <= y               # x is less than or equal to y\n",

    "### Operators \"=\" VS \"==\"\n",

    "**= Operator**\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable.  There is always two sides to an assignment operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Left Hand Side (LHS) = Right Hand Side (RHS)\n",
    "\n",
    "The RHS can be a single value or a very long expression.  Python will evaluate the RHS into one value and that value is assigned to the LHS\n",
    "\n",

    "Examples of assignment operator\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 9\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**== Operator**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Although these operations are probably familiar to you, the Python symbols are different from the mathematical symbols. A common error is to use a single equal sign (**=**) instead of a double equal sign (**==**). Remember that = is an assignment operator and == is a comparison operator. Also, there is no such thing as **=<** or **=>**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note too that an equality test is symmetric, but assignment is not. For example, if a == 7 then 7 == a. But in Python, the statement a = 7 is legal and 7 = a is not. (Can you explain why?)\n",
