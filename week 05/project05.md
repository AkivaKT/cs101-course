# 05 - Project : Area Calculator

# 0 - Setup

The following project will require you write and run your own Python code.  There are a number of ways to do this.

- Thonny on your computer.
- Online sites such as https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ or https://www.trinket.io/.  You are able to create free accounts on these websites.
- You are free to write your project in either version 2 or 3 of Python. However, I would prefer you write your project using Python 3.  Just remember what the differences are between version 2 and 3.


# 1 - Objectives

- Using if statements.
- Calculate area of simple shapes using math.

# 2 - Overview

This project will implement an area shape program.  Your project will prompt the user on which type of shape the area should be calculated.  The valid shapes are:

## Circle

The area of a circle is calculated with the equation:

> area = PI * radius<sup>2</sup>

## Triangle

The area of a circle is calculated with the equation:

> area = 0.5 * base * height

## Rectangle

The area of a circle is calculated with the equation:

> area = width * height


# 3 - Instructions

## 3.1 - Sample Output

Here is sample output of your project.

**Selecting Circle**

```
Enter C for Circle, T for Triangle or R for Rectangle: C
Enter radius: 3.5
Area of the Circle is = 38.4844775
```

**Selecting Triangle**

```
Enter C for Circle, T for Triangle or R for Rectangle: T
Enter base: 9.2
Enter height: 4.98
Area of the Triangle is = 22.908
```

**Selecting Rectangle**

```
Enter C for Circle, T for Triangle or R for Rectangle: R
Enter width: 12.34
Enter height: 23.45
Area of the Rectangle is = 289.373
```

**Invalid Choice**

```
Enter C for Circle, T for Triangle or R for Rectangle: W
Not a valid option
```

## 3.2 - Your Project

For your project, impliment all of the different area shape calculations.  
- Use the statment input() to get information from the user.
- Use the area equations in this project document.
- Convert input from the user to float values for your calculations.


# 4 - Submitting

After you have finished writting and testing your program:

1. Take a screen shot of your code and the results of running your code.  You should be able to do this in one screen shot.  If not, take screen shots of each.
2. Upload your screen shot image(s) to the Assignment Section in I-Learn for the course.  You will find an item for this project.
